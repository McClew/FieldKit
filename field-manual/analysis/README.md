# Analysis

This section of the Field Manual focuses on the critical process of interpreting and synthesising the raw data collected during the "Intelligence" phase. This stage moves beyond data collection to actively make sense of the gathered information: identifying patterns, prioritising findings, and formulating actionable strategies.

The primary objective of analysis is to transform disparate data into a coherent understanding of the target's security posture, identify exploitable weaknesses, and devise effective attack plans. Key activities within this phase include:

* **Attack Path Planning:** Developing strategic sequences of actions and techniques to achieve specific objectives within the target environment, leveraging identified vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Employing automated tools and manual techniques to identify known security flaws in systems, applications, and network devices based on the intelligence gathered.
* **Data Correlation:** Connecting seemingly unrelated pieces of information to reveal deeper insights into the target's architecture, relationships, and potential weak points.
* **Risk Prioritisation:** Assessing the severity and exploitability of identified vulnerabilities to focus efforts on the most impactful avenues.

By thoroughly analysing the gathered intelligence, this phase allows for the transition from passive information gathering to proactive and targeted exploitation, ensuring that subsequent actions are strategic, efficient, and maximize the likelihood of achieving the engagement's goals.
