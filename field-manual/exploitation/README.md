# Exploitation

This section details the active phase where identified vulnerabilities are leveraged to gain unauthorised access to systems or achieve specific objectives within the target environment. Building directly upon the intelligence gathered and the attack paths planned, this stage involves the practical application of various techniques to compromise target assets.

This phase is where theoretical vulnerabilities are put to the test, aiming to establish control, extract sensitive information, or prove the feasibility of an attack scenario.

Key areas and techniques covered include:

* **Authentication Bypass:** Methods used to circumvent or defeat authentication mechanisms, gaining access without valid credentials.
* **Brute-Force:** Automated attempts to guess credentials or keys by systematically trying numerous combinations.
* **Initial Access:** Techniques employed to gain the very first foothold within a target network or system.
* **Privilege Escalation:** Methods used to elevate access rights on a compromised system, moving from a low-privileged user to a higher-privileged account.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a remote system, often leading to full system compromise.

The objective of the Exploitation phase is to demonstrate the real-world impact of identified weaknesses, proving that theoretical vulnerabilities can indeed be weaponised to achieve an attacker's goals. This phase typically leads to the establishment of persistent access and sets the stage for post-exploitation activities.
