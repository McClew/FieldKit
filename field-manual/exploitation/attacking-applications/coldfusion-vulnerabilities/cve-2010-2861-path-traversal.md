# CVE-2010-2861 - Path Traversal

Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in the administrator console in _**Adobe ColdFusion 9.0.1 and earlier**_ allow remote attackers to read arbitrary files via the locale parameter to:

1. CFIDE/administrator/settings/mappings.cfm
2. logging/settings.cfm
3. datasources/index.cfm
4. j2eepackaging/editarchive.cfm
5. enter.cfm in CFIDE/administrator/

## Exploitation

The `password.properties` file in ColdFusion is a configuration file that securely stores encrypted passwords for various services and resources the ColdFusion server uses. It contains a list of key-value pairs, where the key represents the resource name and the value is the encrypted password.

These encrypted passwords are used for services like `database connections`, `mail servers`, `LDAP servers`, and other resources that require authentication. By storing encrypted passwords in this file, ColdFusion can automatically retrieve and use them to authenticate with the respective services without requiring the manual entry of passwords each time.

The file is usually in the `[cf_root]/lib` directory and can be managed through the ColdFusion Administrator.

{% code title="Command" %}
```bash
python2 14641.py 10.129.204.230 8500 "../../../../../../../../ColdFusion8/lib/password.properties"
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Output" %}
