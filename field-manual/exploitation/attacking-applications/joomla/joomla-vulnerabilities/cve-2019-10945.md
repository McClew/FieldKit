This is a directory traversal and authenticated file deletion vulnerability. We can use [this](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46710) exploit script to leverage the vulnerability and list the contents of the webroot and other directories.

## Python3 Exploit Script

{% endhint %}

We can also use it to delete files (not recommended). This could lead to access to sensitive files such as a configuration file or script holding credentials if we can then access it via the application URL. An attacker could also cause damage by deleting necessary files if the web server user has the proper permissions.

We can run the script by specifying the `--url`, `--username`, `--password`, and `--dir` flags. As pentesters, this would only be useful to us if the admin login portal is not accessible from the outside since, armed with admin credentials, we can gain remote code execution.

{% code title="Python 2.7 Script Execution" %}
```bash
python2.7 joomla_dir_trav.py --url "http://<URL>/administrator/" --username admin --password admin --dir /
```
{% endcode %}
