# Thick Client Exploitation

## **Attacks**

### **Client Side attacks**

Although thick clients perform significant processing and data storage on the client side, they still communicate with servers for various tasks, such as data synchronisation or accessing shared resources. This interaction with servers and other external systems can expose thick clients to vulnerabilities similar to those found in web applications, including command injection, weak access control, and SQL injection.

Sensitive information like usernames and passwords, tokens, or strings for communication with other services, might be stored in the application's local files. Hardcoded credentials and other sensitive information can also be found in the application's source code, thus Static Analysis is a necessary step while testing the application. Using the proper tools, we can reverse-engineer and examine .NET and Java applications including EXE, DLL, JAR, CLASS, WAR, and other file formats. Dynamic analysis should also be performed in this step, as thick client applications store sensitive information in the memory as well.

### **Network Side Attacks**

If the application is communicating with a local or remote server, network traffic analysis will help us capture sensitive information that might be transferred through HTTP/HTTPS or TCP/UDP connection, and give us a better understanding of how that application is working. Penetration testers that are performing traffic analysis on thick client applications should be familiar with tools like:

### **Server Side Attacks**

Server-side attacks in thick client applications are similar to web application attacks, and penetration testers should pay attention to the most common ones including most of the OWASP Top Ten.
