# Group Privileges

Windows servers, especially Domain Controllers, have a variety of built-in groups that either ship with the operating system or get added when the Active Directory Domain Services role is installed on a system to promote a server to a Domain Controller.

Many built-in groups provide special privileges, and some can be leveraged to escalate privileges on a server.&#x20;

[Here](https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-security_groups.html) is a listing of all built-in Windows groups along with a detailed description of each.

This [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/security-best-practices/appendix-b--privileged-accounts-and-groups-in-active-directory) has a detailed listing of privileged accounts and groups in Active Directory.
