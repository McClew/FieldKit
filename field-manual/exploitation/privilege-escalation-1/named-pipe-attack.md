# Named Pipe Attack

## Windscribe Service

Using `accesschk` we can search for all named pipes that allow write access with a command such as `accesschk.exe -w \pipe\* -v` and notice that the `WindscribeService` named pipe allows `READ` and `WRITE` access to the `Everyone` group, meaning all authenticated users.

{% endhint %}

Confirming with `accesschk` we see that the Everyone group does indeed have `FILE_ALL_ACCESS` (All possible access rights) over the pipe.

```sh
C:\> accesschk.exe -accepteula -w \pipe\WindscribeService -v

```

From here, we could leverage these lax permissions to escalate privileges on the host to SYSTEM.
