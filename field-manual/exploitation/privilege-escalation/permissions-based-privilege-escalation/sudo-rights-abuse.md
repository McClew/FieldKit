# Sudo Rights Abuse

Sudo privileges can be granted to an account, permitting the account to run certain commands in the context of the root (or another account) without having to change users or grant excessive privileges. When the `sudo` command is issued, the system will check if the user issuing the command has the appropriate rights, as configured in `/etc/sudoers`.

When landing on a system, we should always check to see if the current user has any sudo privileges by typing `sudo -l`. Sometimes we will need to know the user's password to list their `sudo` rights, but any rights entries with the `NOPASSWD` option can be seen without entering a password.
