# Kubernetes

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is a container orchestration system, which functions by running all applications in containers isolated from the host system through multiple layers of protection. This approach ensures that applications are not affected by changes in the host system, such as updates or security patches. The K8s architecture comprises a **master node** and **worker nodes**, each with specific roles.

Kubernetes architecture is primarily divided into two types of components:

* `The Control Plane` (master node), which is responsible for controlling the Kubernetes cluster
* `The Worker Nodes` (minions), where the containerised applications are run
