# Passive Traffic Capture

If **tcpdump** is installed, unprivileged users may be able to capture network traffic, including, in some cases, credentials passed in cleartext. Several tools exist, such as [net-creds](https://github.com/DanMcInerney/net-creds) and [PCredz](https://github.com/lgandx/PCredz) that can be used to examine data being passed on the wire.

This may result in capturing sensitive information such as credit card numbers and SNMP community strings. It may also be possible to capture Net-NTLMv2, SMBv2, or Kerberos hashes, which could be subjected to an offline brute force attack to reveal the plaintext password. Cleartext protocols such as HTTP, FTP, POP, IMAP, telnet, or SMTP may contain credentials that could be reused to escalate privileges on the host.
