# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a common vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious code into a website. Here's a quick summary of how it works and its potential impact:

How XSS Works: A typical web application sends code from a server to a user's browser. If a site doesn't properly check user input, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a field like a comment box. When another user views that page, their browser runs the malicious code without them knowing.

Impact and Risk: XSS attacks only affect the user's browser, not the back-end server. However, because they are so common, they pose a medium risk (low impact, but high probability). Therefore, it's crucial for developers to detect, fix, and prevent these vulnerabilities to protect users.
