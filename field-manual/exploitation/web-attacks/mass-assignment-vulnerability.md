# Mass Assignment Vulnerability

Web mass assignment vulnerability is a type of security vulnerability where attackers can modify the model attributes of an application through the parameters sent to the server. Reversing the code, attackers can see these parameters and by assigning values to critical unprotected parameters during the HTTP request, they can edit the data of a database and change the intended functionality of an application.

## Example Exploitation

The following example application features an Asset Manager web application. Also suppose that the application's source code has been provided to us. Completing the registration step, we get the message `Success!!`, and we can try to log in.

After login in, we get the message `Account is pending approval`. The administrator of this web app must approve our registration. Reviewing the python code of the `/opt/asset-manager/app.py` file reveals the following snippet.

```python
for i,j,k in cur.execute('select * from users where username=? and password=?',(username,password)):
  if k:
    session['user']=i
    return redirect("/home",code=302)
  else:
    return render_template('login.html',value='Account is pending for approval')
```

We can see that the application is checking if the value `k` is set. If yes, then it allows the user to log in. In the code below, we can also see that if we set the `confirmed` parameter during registration, then it inserts `cond` as `True` and allows us to bypass the registration checking step.

```python
try:
  if request.form['confirmed']:
    cond=True
except:
      cond=False
with sqlite3.connect("database.db") as con:
  cur = con.cursor()
  cur.execute('select * from users where username=?',(username,))
  if cur.fetchone():
    return render_template('index.html',value='User exists!!')
  else:
    cur.execute('insert into users values(?,?,?)',(username,password,cond))
    con.commit()
    return render_template('index.html',value='Success!!')
```

In that case, what we should try is to register another user and try setting the `confirmed` parameter to a random value. Using Burp Suite, we can capture the HTTP POST request to the `/register` page and set the parameters `username=new&password=test&confirmed=test`.

We can now try to log in to the application using the `new:test` credentials.

The mass assignment vulnerability is exploited successfully and we are now logged into the web app without waiting for the administrator to approve our registration request.
