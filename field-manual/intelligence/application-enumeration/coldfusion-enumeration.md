# ColdFusion Enumeration

## Discovery & Footprinting

During a penetration testing enumeration, several ways exist to identify whether a web application uses ColdFusion. Here are some methods that can be used:

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="146">Method</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>Port Scanning</code></td><td>ColdFusion typically uses port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS by default. So, scanning for these ports may indicate the presence of a ColdFusion server. Nmap might be able to identify ColdFusion during a services scan specifically.</td></tr><tr><td><code>File Extensions</code></td><td>ColdFusion pages typically use ".cfm" or ".cfc" file extensions. If you find pages with these file extensions, it could be an indicator that the application is using ColdFusion.</td></tr><tr><td><code>HTTP Headers</code></td><td>Check the HTTP response headers of the web application. ColdFusion typically sets specific headers, such as "Server: ColdFusion" or "X-Powered-By: ColdFusion", that can help identify the technology being used.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Error Messages</code></td><td>If the application uses ColdFusion and there are errors, the error messages may contain references to ColdFusion-specific tags or functions.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Default Files</code></td><td>ColdFusion creates several default files during installation, such as "admin.cfm" or "CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm". Finding these files on the web server may indicate that the web application runs on ColdFusion.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Port Scanning

ColdFusion typically uses port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS by default. So, scanning for these ports may indicate the presence of a ColdFusion server. Nmap might be able to identify ColdFusion during a services scan specifically.

ColdFusion exposes a fair few ports by default:

<table><thead><tr><th width="136">Port Number</th><th width="117">Protocol</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>80</td><td>HTTP</td><td>Used for non-secure HTTP communication between the web server and web browser.</td></tr><tr><td>443</td><td>HTTPS</td><td>Used for secure HTTP communication between the web server and web browser. Encrypts the communication between the web server and web browser.</td></tr><tr><td>1935</td><td>RPC</td><td>Used for client-server communication. Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol allows a program to request information from another program on a different network device.</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>SMTP</td><td>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used for sending email messages.</td></tr><tr><td>8500</td><td>SSL</td><td>Used for server communication via Secure Socket Layer (SSL).</td></tr><tr><td>5500</td><td>Server Monitor</td><td>Used for remote administration of the ColdFusion server.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Example scan:

{% code title="Command" %}
```bash
nmap -p- -sC -Pn 10.129.247.30 --open
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Output" %}
```shell-session
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-03-13 11:45 GMT
Nmap scan report for 10.129.247.30
Host is up (0.028s latency).
Not shown: 65532 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
Some closed ports may be reported as filtered due to --defeat-rst-ratelimit
PORT      STATE SERVICE
135/tcp   open  msrpc
8500/tcp  open  fmtp
49154/tcp open  unknown

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 350.38 seconds
```
{% endcode %}

The port scan results show a service running on `8500` the default port that ColdFusion uses for SSL. Navigating to the `IP:8500` lists 2 directories, `CFIDE` and `cfdocs,` in the root, further indicating that ColdFusion is running on port 8500.

### File Extensions

ColdFusion pages typically use ".cfm" or ".cfc" file extensions. If you find pages with these file extensions, it could be an indicator that the application is using ColdFusion.

The `/CFIDE/administrator` path loads the ColdFusion 8 Administrator login page. Now we know for certain that `ColdFusion 8` is running on the server.
