# Jenkins Enumeration

{% hint style="info" %}
## Jenkins Instances

Jenkins is often installed on Windows servers running as the all-powerful SYSTEM account.

If we can gain access via Jenkins and gain remote code execution as the SYSTEM account, we would have a foothold in Active Directory to begin enumeration of the domain environment.
{% endhint %}

## Discovery/Footprinting

Jenkins runs on Tomcat port `8080` by default. It also utilises port `5000` to attach slave servers.This port is used to communicate between masters and slaves.

Jenkins can use a local database, LDAP, Unix user database, delegate security to a servlet container, or use no authentication at all. Administrators can also allow or disallow users from creating accounts.

### Default Login Page

The default installation typically uses Jenkinsâ€™ database to store credentials and does not allow users to register an account. We can fingerprint Jenkins quickly by the telltale login page.
