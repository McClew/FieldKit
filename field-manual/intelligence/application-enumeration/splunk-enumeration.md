# Splunk Enumeration

Splunk is a log analytics tool used to gather, analyse and visualise data. Though not originally intended to be a SIEM tool, Splunk is often used for security monitoring and business analytics. Splunk deployments are often used to house sensitive data and could provide a wealth of information for an attacker if compromised.

## Default Port

The Splunk web server runs by default on port 8000.
{% endhint %}

## Trial Version

The Splunk Enterprise trial converts to a free version after 60 days, which doesnâ€™t require authentication. It is not uncommon for system administrators to install a trial of Splunk to test it out, which is subsequently forgotten about.

This will automatically convert to the free version that **does not have any form of authentication**, introducing a security hole in the environment. Some organisations may opt for the free version due to budget constraints, not fully understanding the implications of having no user/role management.

## Discovery/Footprinting

We can discover Splunk with a quick Nmap service scan. Here we can see that Nmap identified the `Splunkd httpd` service on port 8000 and port 8089, the Splunk management port for communication with the Splunk REST API.
