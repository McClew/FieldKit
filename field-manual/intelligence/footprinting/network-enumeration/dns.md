# DNS

DNS offers a variety of information about public - and sometimes private - servers, such as IP addresses, server names, and server functionality.

## DNS Enumeration

## Subdomain Enumeration

Subdomain enumeration is the process of systematically identifying and listing subdomains. From a DNS perspective, subdomains are typically represented by A (or AAAA for IPv6) records, which map the subdomain name to its corresponding IP address. Additionally, CNAME records might be used to create aliases for subdomains, pointing them to other domains or subdomains.

| Tool        | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DNSEnum     | Automated DNS enumeration tool, dictionary attacks, brute-forcing, zone transfers (if allowed).                                                                |

Subdomains can also be enumerated using scripts: DNS Lookup Brute Force DNS Reverse Lookup Brute Force

## Virtual Host (VHost) Enumeration

Virtual hosting is the ability of web servers to distinguish between multiple websites or applications sharing the same IP address. This is achieved by leveraging the HTTP Host header, a piece of information included in every HTTP request sent by a web browser.

| Tool        | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| gobuster    | A multi-purpose tool often used for directory/file brute-forcing, but also effective for virtual host discovery. Fast, supports multiple HTTP methods, can use custom wordlists. |
| Feroxbuster | Similar to Gobuster, but with a Rust-based implementation, known for its speed and flexibility. Supports recursion, wildcard discovery, and various filters.                     |
| ffuf        | Another fast web fuzzer that can be used for virtual host discovery by fuzzing the Host header. Customizable wordlist input and filtering options.                               |

## DNS Zone Transfer Enumeration

A DNS zone transfer is a mechanism used to replicate DNS data between DNS servers. This process includes the copying of the zone file from a master DNS server to a slave server. The zone file contains a list of all the DNS names configured for that zone. Zone transfers should be limited to authorised slave DNS servers.

A zone transfer can be requested with dig:

```bash
clue@machine[/]$ dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me
