# 389, 636, 3268, 3269 - LDAP

LDAP (**Lightweight Directory Access Protocol**) is a protocol used to access and manage directory information. A directory is a hierarchical data store that contains information about network resources such as **users**, **groups**, **computers**, **printers**, and **other devices.**

LDAP is commonly used for providing a **central location** for **accessing** and **managing** _**directory services**_. Directory services are collections of information about the organisation, its users, and assets–like usernames and passwords. LDAP enables organisations to store, manage, and secure this information in a standardised way.

## CLI Interaction

[ldapsearch.md](../../../toolbox/tooling/information-gathering/service-enumeration/ldapsearch.md "mention") is a command-line utility used to search for information stored in a directory using the LDAP protocol. It is commonly used to query and retrieve data from an LDAP directory service.
