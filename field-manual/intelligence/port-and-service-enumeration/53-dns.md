# 53 - DNS

DNS translates domain names to IP addresses. DNS primarily uses **UDP /53**, but DNS will rely on **TCP /53**. DNS has always been designed to use both UDP and TCP port 53 from the start, with UDP being the default, and falls back to using TCP when it cannot communicate on UDP, typically when the packet size is too large to push through in a single UDP packet.

{% hint style="info" %}
Default Port: 53
{% endhint %}

DNS holds interesting information for an organisation, it can provide more data to understand how a company operates and the services they provide, as well as third-party service providers like emails.

## Basic Enumeration

The Nmap `-sC` (default scripts) and `-sV` (version scan) options can be used to perform initial enumeration against the target DNS servers:

```bash
clue@machine[~]$ nmap -p53 -Pn -sV -sC 10.10.110.213

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-10-29 03:47 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.110.213
Host is up (0.017s latency).

PORT    STATE  SERVICE     VERSION
53/tcp  open   domain      ISC BIND 9.11.3-1ubuntu1.2 (Ubuntu Linux)
```

## Subdomain Enumeration

Subdomains can be enumerated for a target domain using tools like [subfinder.md](../../../toolbox/tooling/information-gathering/subfinder.md "mention"). This tool can scrape subdomains from open sources like [dnsdumpster.md](../../../toolbox/tooling/information-gathering/dnsdumpster.md "mention").

```bash
clue@machine[~]$ ./subfinder -d inlanefreight.com -v       
                                                                       
        _     __ _         _                                           
____  _| |__ / _(_)_ _  __| |___ _ _          
(_-< || | '_ \  _| | ' \/ _  / -_) '_|                 
/__/\_,_|_.__/_| |_|_||_\__,_\___|_| v2.4.5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                projectdiscovery.io

Other tools like [sublist3r.md](../../../toolbox/tooling/information-gathering/sublist3r.md "mention") can also be used to brute-force subdomains by supplying a wordlist.&#x20;

An excellent alternative is a tool called [subbrute.md](../../../toolbox/tooling/information-gathering/subbrute.md "mention"). This tool allows us to use self-defined resolvers and perform pure DNS brute-forcing attacks during internal penetration tests on hosts that do not have Internet access.

```shell-session
clue@machine[~]$ git clone https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute.git >> /dev/null 2>&1
clue@machine[~]$ cd subbrute
clue@machine[~]$ echo "ns1.inlanefreight.com" > ./resolvers.txt
clue@machine[~]$ ./subbrute inlanefreight.com -s ./names.txt -r ./resolvers.txt

Warning: Fewer than 16 resolvers per process, consider adding more nameservers to resolvers.txt.
inlanefreight.com
ns2.inlanefreight.com
www.inlanefreight.com
ms1.inlanefreight.com
support.inlanefreight.com

<SNIP>
```

The tool has found four subdomains associated with `inlanefreight.com`. Using the `nslookup` or `host` command, we can enumerate the `CNAME` records for those subdomains.

```bash
clue@machine[~]# host support.inlanefreight.com

support.inlanefreight.com is an alias for inlanefreight.s3.amazonaws.com
```

The `support` subdomain has an alias record pointing to an AWS S3 bucket. However, the URL `https://support.inlanefreight.com` shows a `NoSuchBucket` error indicating that the subdomain is potentially vulnerable to a subdomain takeover. Now, we can take over the subdomain by creating an AWS S3 bucket with the same subdomain name.

The [can-i-take-over-xyz](https://github.com/EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz) repository is also an excellent reference for a subdomain takeover vulnerability. It shows whether the target services are vulnerable to a subdomain takeover and provides guidelines on assessing the vulnerability.

## DNS Zone Transfer

A DNS zone is a portion of the DNS namespace that a specific organisation or administrator manages. Since DNS comprises multiple DNS zones, DNS servers utilise DNS zone transfers to copy a portion of their database to another DNS server.

Unless a DNS server is configured correctly (limiting which IPs can perform a DNS zone transfer), anyone can ask a DNS server for a copy of its zone information since DNS zone transfers do not require any authentication. In addition, the DNS service usually runs on a UDP port; however, when performing DNS zone transfer, it uses a TCP port for reliable data transmission.

An attacker could leverage this DNS zone transfer vulnerability to learn more about the target organisation's DNS namespace, increasing the attack surface. For exploitation, we can use the `dig` utility with DNS query type `AXFR` option to dump the entire DNS namespaces from a vulnerable DNS server:

### Zone Transfer Using Dig

```bash
clue@machine[~]$ dig AXFR @ns1.inlanefreight.htb inlanefreight.htb

### Zone Transfer with Fierce

Tools like [fierce.md](../../../toolbox/tooling/information-gathering/fierce.md "mention") can also be used to enumerate all DNS servers of the root domain and scan for a DNS zone transfer:

```bash
clue@machine[~]$ fierce --domain zonetransfer.me

SOA: nsztm1.digi.ninja. (81.4.108.41)
