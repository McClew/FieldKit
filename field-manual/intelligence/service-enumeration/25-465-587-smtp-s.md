# 25, 465, 587 - SMTP/S

The **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)** is a protocol utilized within the TCP/IP suite for the **sending and receiving of e-mail**. Due to its limitations in queuing messages at the recipient's end, SMTP is often employed alongside either **POP3 or IMAP**. These additional protocols enable users to store messages on a server mailbox and to periodically download them.

Default port: 25, 465(SSL), 587(SSL)
{% endhint %}

In practice, it is common for **e-mail programs** to employ **SMTP for sending e-mails**, while utilizing **POP3 or IMAP for receiving** them. On systems based on Unix, **sendmail** stands out as the SMTP server most frequently used for e-mail purposes. The commercial package known as Sendmail encompasses a POP3 server. Furthermore, **Microsoft Exchange** provides an SMTP server and offers the option to include POP3 support.

```bash
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON  VERSION
