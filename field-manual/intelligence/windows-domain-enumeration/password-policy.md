# Password Policy

## Credentialed

With valid domain credentials, the password policy can also be obtained remotely.

```bash
crackmapexec smb $IP -u $USER -p $PASS --pass-pol
```

## SMB NULL Sessions

SMB NULL sessions allow an unauthenticated attacker to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy. SMB NULL session misconfigurations are often the result of legacy Domain Controllers (**Windows Server 2003 and earlier)** being upgraded in place, ultimately bringing along insecure configurations, which existed by default in older versions of Windows Server.

```bash
rpcclient -U "" -N $IP
```

## LDAP Anonymous Bind

[LDAP anonymous binds](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/anonymous-ldap-operations-active-directory-disabled) allow unauthenticated attackers to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy. This is a legacy configuration, and as of **Windows Server 2003**, only authenticated users are permitted to initiate LDAP requests.

## Authenticated Windows Host

If we can authenticate to the domain from a Windows host, we can use built-in Windows binaries such as `net.exe` to retrieve the password policy. We can also use various tools such as PowerView, CrackMapExec ported to Windows, SharpMapExec, SharpView, etc.
