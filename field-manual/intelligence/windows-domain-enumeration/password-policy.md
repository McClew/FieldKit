# Password Policy

## Credentialed

With valid domain credentials, the password policy can also be obtained remotely.

```bash
crackmapexec smb $IP -u $USER -p $PASS --pass-pol
```

### Tools

<table><thead><tr><th width="196">Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a data-mention href="../../../toolbox/tooling/post-exploitation/crackmapexec.md">crackmapexec.md</a></td><td>An open-source tool that automates the assessment of Active Directory networks by leveraging various protocols to perform reconnaissance, credential gathering, lateral movement, and exploitation.</td></tr><tr><td><a data-mention href="../../../toolbox/tooling/information-gathering/service-enumeration/rpcclient.md">rpcclient.md</a></td><td>A command-line tool, part of the Samba suite, used to connect to and interact with Windows SMB/MS-RPC services, primarily for administration and network enumeration of users, groups, shares, and other domain information.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## SMB NULL Sessions

SMB NULL sessions allow an unauthenticated attacker to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy. SMB NULL session misconfigurations are often the result of legacy Domain Controllers (**Windows Server 2003 and earlier)** being upgraded in place, ultimately bringing along insecure configurations, which existed by default in older versions of Windows Server.

```bash
rpcclient -U "" -N $IP
```

## LDAP Anonymous Bind

[LDAP anonymous binds](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/anonymous-ldap-operations-active-directory-disabled) allow unauthenticated attackers to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy. This is a legacy configuration, and as of **Windows Server 2003**, only authenticated users are permitted to initiate LDAP requests.

## Authenticated Windows Host

If we can authenticate to the domain from a Windows host, we can use built-in Windows binaries such as `net.exe` to retrieve the password policy. We can also use various tools such as PowerView, CrackMapExec ported to Windows, SharpMapExec, SharpView, etc.
