# Post-Engagement

This section outlines the essential activities performed _after_ all active penetration testing and exploitation phases have concluded. This critical final stage focuses on reporting findings, providing recommendations, and formally closing out the assessment.

This phase is paramount for ensuring that the client receives actionable intelligence regarding their security posture and that the value of the penetration test is fully realised.

Key elements covered in this section include:

* **Executive Report:** A high-level summary of the engagement's findings, risks, and strategic recommendations tailored for senior management and non-technical stakeholders. It focuses on the business impact of identified vulnerabilities.
* **Technical Report:** A comprehensive and detailed document outlining all findings, methodologies used, technical steps for reproduction, and specific remediation advice for technical teams.

The objective of the Post-Engagement phase is to effectively communicate the results of the assessment, provide clear guidance for remediation, and ensure that the client gains maximum benefit from the penetration test, ultimately enhancing their overall security resilience.
