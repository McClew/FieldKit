# Attestation Report / Letter

Some clients will request an `Attestation Letter` or `Attestation Report` that is suitable for their vendors or customers who require evidence that they've had a penetration test done. The most significant difference is that your client will not want to hand over the specific technical details of all of the findings or credentials or other secret information that may be included to a third party.

This document can be derived from the report. It should focus only on the number of findings discovered, the approach taken, and general comments about the environment itself. This document should likely only be a page or two long.
