# Appendices

There are appendices that should appear in every report, but others will be dynamic and may not be necessary for all reports. If any of these appendices bloat the size of the report unnecessarily, you may want to consider whether a supplemental spreadsheet would be a better way to present the data (not to mention the enhanced ability to sort and filter).

## Static Appendices

### Scope

Shows the scope of the assessment (URLs, network ranges, facilities, etc.). Most auditors that the client has to hand your report to will need to see this.

### Methodology

Explain the repeatable process you follow to ensure that your assessments are thorough and consistent.

### Severity Ratings

If your severity ratings don't directly map to a CVSS score or something similar, you will need to articulate the criteria necessary to meet your severity definitions. You will have to defend this occasionally, so make sure it is sound and can be backed up with logic and that the findings you include in your report are rated accordingly.

### Biographies

If you perform assessments with the intent of fulfilling PCI compliance specifically, the report should include a bio about the personnel performing the assessment with the specific goal of articulating that the consultant is adequately qualified to perform the assessment. Even without compliance obligations, it can help give the client peace of mind that the person doing their assessment knew what they were doing.

## Dynamic Appendices

### Exploitation Attempts and Payloads

If you've ever done anything in incident response, you should know how many artifacts are left behind after a penetration test for the forensics guys to try and sift through. Be respectful and keep track of the stuff you did so that if they experience an incident, they can differentiate what was you versus an actual attacker. If you generate custom payloads, particularly if you drop them on disk, you should also include the details of those payloads here, so the client knows exactly where to go and what to look for to get rid of them. This is especially important for payloads that you cannot clean up yourself.

### Compromised Credentials

If a large number of accounts were compromised, it is helpful to list them here (if you compromise the entire domain, it might be a wasted effort to list out every user account instead of just saying "all domain accounts") so that the client can take action against them if necessary.

### Configuration Changes

If you made any configuration changes in the client environment (hopefully you asked first), you should itemize all of them so that the client can revert them and eliminate any risks you introduced into the environment (like disabling EDR or something). Obviously, it's ideal if you put things back the way you found them yourself and get approval in writing from the client to change things to prevent getting yelled at later on if your change has unintended consequences for a revenue-generating process.

### Additional Affected Scope

If you have a finding with a list of affected hosts that would be too much to include with the finding itself, you can usually reference an appendix in the finding to see a complete list of the affected hosts where you can create a table to display them in multiple columns. This helps keep the report clean instead of having a bulleted list several pages long.

### Information Gathering

If the assessment is an External Penetration test, we may include additional data to help the client understand their external footprint. This could include whois data, domain ownership information, subdomains, discovered emails, accounts found in public breach data ([DeHashed](https://www.dehashed.com/) is great for this), an analysis of the client's SSL/TLS configurations, and even a listing of externally accessible ports/services (in a large scope external you'd likely want to make a supplementary spreadsheet). This data can be beneficial in a low-to-no-finding report but should convey some sort of value to the client and not just be "fluff."

### Domain Password Analysis

If you're able to gain Domain Admin access and dump the NTDS database, it's a good idea to run this through Hashcat with multiple wordlists and rules and even brute-force NTLM up through eight characters if your password cracking rig is powerful enough. Once you've exhausted your cracking attempts, a tool such as [DPAT](https://github.com/clr2of8/DPAT) can be used to produce a nice report with various statistics.

You may want just to include some key stats from this report (i.e., number of hashes obtained, number and percentage cracked, number of privileged accounts cracks (think Domain Admins and Enterprise Admins), top X passwords, and the number of passwords cracked for each character length). This can help drive home themes in the Executive Summary and Findings sections regarding weak passwords. You may also wish to provide the client with the entire DPAT report as supplementary data.

### Changes/Host Cleanup

You must document every change made to a host, including web shells uploaded (with MD5 sums), local users created, or files transferred. This allows the client to revert the environment and distinguish your actions from a real breach.
