# Recommendations Summary

Before we get into the technical findings, it's a good idea to provide a Summary of Recommendations or Remediation Summary section. Here we can list our short, medium, and long-term recommendations based on our findings and the current state of the client's environment. We'll need to use our experience and knowledge of the client's business, security budget, staffing considerations, etc., to make accurate recommendations. Our clients will often have input on this section, so we want to get it right, or the recommendations are useless.

If we structure this properly, our clients can use it as the basis for a remediation roadmap. If you opt not to do this, be prepared for clients to ask you to prioritize remediation for them. It may not happen all the time, but if you have a report with 15 high-risk findings and nothing else, they're likely going to want to know which of them is "the most high." As the saying goes, "when everything is important, nothing is important."

We should tie each recommendation back to a specific finding and not include any short or medium-term recommendations that are not actionable by remediating findings reported later in the report. Long-term recommendations may map back to informational/best practice recommendations such as `"Create baseline security templates for Windows Server and Workstation hosts"` but may also be catch-all recommendations such as `"Perform periodic Social Engineering engagements with follow-on debriefings and security awareness training to build a security-focused culture within the organization from the top down."`

Some findings could have an associated short and long-term recommendation. For example, if a particular patch is missing in many places, that is a sign that the organization struggles with patch management and perhaps does not have a strong patch management program, along with associated policies and procedures. The short-term solution would be to push out the relevant patches, while the long-term objective would be to review patch and vulnerability management processes to address any gaps that would prevent the same issue from cropping up again. In the application security world, it might instead be fixing the code in the short term and in the long term, reviewing the SDLC to ensure security is considered early enough in the development process to prevent these issues from making it into production.
