# Slide Deck

You may also be requested to prepare a presentation that can be given at several different levels. Your audience may be technical, or they may be more executive. The language and focus should be as different in your executive presentation as the executive summary is from the technical finding details in your report.

Only including graphs and numbers will put your audience to sleep, so it's best to be prepared with some anecdotes from your own experience or perhaps some recent current events that correlate to a specific attack vector or compromise. Bonus points if said story is in the same industry as your client.

The purpose of this is not fear-mongering, and you should be careful not to present it that way, but it will help hold your audience's attention. It will make the risk relatable enough to maximize their chances of doing something about it.
