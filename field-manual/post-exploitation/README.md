# Post-Exploitation

This section of the Field Manual covers the critical activities performed _after_ initial access to a target system has been successful. This phase focuses on extending control, maintaining persistence, exfiltrating data, and pivoting further into the network to achieve deeper objectives beyond the initial compromise.

This stage is crucial for demonstrating the full impact of a security breach and identifying the true extent of compromise within an organisation's infrastructure.

Key areas and techniques detailed in this section include:

* File Transfer: Methods for reliably moving tools, exploits, and exfiltrated data onto and off compromised systems, often bypassing security controls.
* Lateral Movement: Strategies and techniques for moving from a compromised host to other systems within the network, expanding the footprint of access.
* Persistence: Establishing mechanisms to maintain access to a compromised system, even after reboots or security remediations, ensuring continued control.
* Pivoting, Tunnelling & Port Forwarding: Techniques used to route network traffic through compromised hosts to access otherwise unreachable internal network segments or services.

The ultimate aim of the Post-Exploitation phase is to fully assess the scope of compromise, identify critical assets, and demonstrate the potential for an attacker to achieve deep and lasting control over an organisation's assets.
