## Tooling

| Tool                                                                                                             | Description                                                                     | Features                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [chisel.md](../../../toolbox/tooling/post-exploitation/chisel.md "mention")                                      | A fast TCP/UDP tunnel over HTTP, secured with SSH.                              | Creates SOCKS proxies; supports local and remote port forwarding; single executable; often bypasses firewalls.                           |
| [meterpreter-portwd.md](../../../toolbox/tooling/exploitation-tools/metasploit/meterpreter-portwd.md "mention")  | A built-in command within Metasploit's Meterpreter shell.                       | Establishes local and remote port forwarding rules through a compromised host; integrates directly into Metasploit sessions.             |
| ProxyChains                                                                                                      | A tool that forces applications to route their TCP connections through a proxy. | Integrates with various proxy types (SOCKS, HTTP); allows chaining multiple proxies; useful for non-proxy-aware tools.                   |
| SSH                                                                                                              | Secure Shell client, a ubiquitous protocol.                                     | Provides native capabilities for local, remote, and dynamic (SOCKS) port forwarding; encrypts traffic; widely available.                 |
| Socat                                                                                                            | A versatile command-line utility for bidirectional data relay.                  | Can forward ports, create reverse shells, relay data, and build complex tunnels; highly flexible for various network tasks.              |
| Plink (PuTTY Link)                                                                                               | A command-line SSH client for Windows.                                          | Enables SSH tunnelling (local and remote port forwarding, SOCKS proxy) on Windows machines where SSH may not be natively installed.      |
| Netsh                                                                                                            | A command-line scripting utility in Windows.                                    | Can configure local port proxy rules for basic port forwarding; useful for leveraging built-in Windows capabilities.                     |
| SSHuttle                                                                                                         | A transparent proxy server that works like a VPN.                               | Routes all TCP and DNS traffic through an SSH server; no root access needed on the remote side; simpler setup than some VPNs.            |
| [metasploit](../../../toolbox/tooling/exploitation-tools/metasploit/ "mention") Auxiliaries                      | Modules within Metasploit Framework.                                            | Includes `auxiliary/server/socks_proxy` for establishing SOCKS proxies over existing Metasploit sessions, aiding broader network access. |

## Definitions

### Pivoting

Pivoting is the act of moving laterally or vertically within a target network by leveraging a compromised host - the "pivot host" - to reach previously inaccessible systems or network segments. The primary objective is to bypass segmentation, firewalls, or other security controls to expand access within an isolated network.

### Port Forwarding

Port forwarding is a network address translation (NAT) technique that redirects communication requests from one specific IP address and port combination to another. It is a foundational tool for network management and security testing, often used to expose an internal service to an external network or vice-versa.
