# Pivoting, Tunnelling & Port Forwarding

## Tooling

| Tool                                           | Description                                                                     | Features                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [chisel.md](../../tooling/chisel.md "mention") | A fast TCP/UDP tunnel over HTTP, secured with SSH.                              | Creates SOCKS proxies; supports local and remote port forwarding; single executable; often bypasses firewalls.                           |
| Meterpreter Portfwd                            | A built-in command within Metasploit's Meterpreter shell.                       | Establishes local and remote port forwarding rules through a compromised host; integrates directly into Metasploit sessions.             |
| ProxyChains                                    | A tool that forces applications to route their TCP connections through a proxy. | Integrates with various proxy types (SOCKS, HTTP); allows chaining multiple proxies; useful for non-proxy-aware tools.                   |
| SSH                                            | Secure Shell client, a ubiquitous protocol.                                     | Provides native capabilities for local, remote, and dynamic (SOCKS) port forwarding; encrypts traffic; widely available.                 |
| Socat                                          | A versatile command-line utility for bidirectional data relay.                  | Can forward ports, create reverse shells, relay data, and build complex tunnels; highly flexible for various network tasks.              |
| Plink (PuTTY Link)                             | A command-line SSH client for Windows.                                          | Enables SSH tunnelling (local and remote port forwarding, SOCKS proxy) on Windows machines where SSH may not be natively installed.      |
| Netsh                                          | A command-line scripting utility in Windows.                                    | Can configure local port proxy rules for basic port forwarding; useful for leveraging built-in Windows capabilities.                     |
| SSHuttle                                       | A transparent proxy server that works like a VPN.                               | Routes all TCP and DNS traffic through an SSH server; no root access needed on the remote side; simpler setup than some VPNs.            |
| Metasploit Auxiliaries                         | Modules within Metasploit Framework.                                            | Includes `auxiliary/server/socks_proxy` for establishing SOCKS proxies over existing Metasploit sessions, aiding broader network access. |
