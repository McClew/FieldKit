# Kernel Exploits

## Enumerating Missing Patches

The first step is looking at installed updates and attempting to find updates that may have been missed, thus, opening up an attack path for us.

### Examining Installed Updates

We can examine the installed updates in several ways. Below are three separate commands we can use.

```powershell
PS C:\> systeminfo
PS C:\> wmic qfe list brief
PS C:\> Get-Hotfix
```

### Viewing Installed Updates with WMI

```bash
C:\> wmic qfe list brief

We can search for each KB (Microsoft Knowledge Base ID number) in the [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5000808) to get a better idea of what fixes have been installed and how far behind the system may be on security updates.
