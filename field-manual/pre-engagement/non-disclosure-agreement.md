# Non-Disclosure Agreement

An Non-Disclosure Agreement (**NDA**) is a legal document that plays one of the most important roles in penetration testing. It is a written contract between two parties—the penetration tester and the company (customer) — that ensures any sensitive information shared between them remains confidential. When we look at a company's systems, we might encounter various sensitive details, such as:

* Security weaknesses that could be exploited
* Private company information and trade secrets
* Employee and customer data
* Details about how the company's systems work

The NDA creates a safe environment/agreement for both sides. The company can feel comfortable letting us examine their systems, knowing their secrets won't be shared with anyone and at the same time, we can work without worrying about legal problems that might come from handling sensitive information.

Often we can discover serious security problems that could damage the company if made public. For example, we might find ways to access private data or how to break into important, mission-critical systems. If this information were fall into the wrong hands, it could lead to real cyber attacks or data breaches. The NDA helps prevent these risks by making sure all findings stay confidential. Without this protection in place, neither the company nor we would feel safe working together. The NDA covers _everything about handling private information_, including how to store and share any information we find, such as:

* System details
* Software code
* Passwords
* Company rules
* Network setup

The NDA also states that we can't share our findings with others, or use them for personal benefit. It sets clear rules about which systems we can and can not access during testing. Some topics should only be discussed after both parties sign the NDA, and any conversations that happen prior to the NDA should stay general. However, after signing, you are free to talk about almost everything including:

* Which systems will be tested
* Past security problems
* Important company processes
* Login details needed for testing

This careful approach keeps everyone's information safe and helps create a good working relationship. Now, for the practical aspect, let’s say we already have a signed NDA.
