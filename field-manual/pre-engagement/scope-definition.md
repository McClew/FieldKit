# Scope Definition

## The Scoping Process

Two main tools help plan a penetration test:

1. the scoping questionnaire and
2. the scoping document.

The **scoping questionnaire** is a checklist that helps gather basic information about what needs to be tested. It asks about the company's systems, security needs, and goals for the test.

The **scoping document** is more detailed. It's created using information from the questionnaire and clearly explains what will be tested, how it will be tested, and what the limits are.

These tools help make everything clear by covering (in this example):

* Which systems will be tested: 2 hosts in total, 1 Web Application running on Linux, 1 Windows-based server (both IPs given after spawning the targets)
* What type of testing will be done: Black box
* What the test aims to achieve: Ensure the new small environment is secure.

In the real world, the scoping questionnaire and document will be much more extensive. However, for the purposes of this module, this case is enough. Even now, using these two tools will help us avoid confusion and keep the project on track.

## Defining the Scope of Work

Before we can start with the penetration testing engagement, the final plan needs to include:

* **Goals**: What the company wants to achieve - in our case: cyber security assessment confirming their systems are secure
* **Limits**: What will and won't be tested - only the 2 provided hosts (Web application on Linux and the Windows host)
* **Methods**: How the testing will be done - Black box, without prior knowledge of the web application, the Linux host nor the Windows host
* **Schedule**: When things will happen - for us: take your time as much as you need
* **Our Role**: Assisting our penetration testing team during their engagement
* **Results**: What reports and recommendations will be provided - we are tasked to provide our findings to the team lead\
