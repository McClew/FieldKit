If we disable port scan (`-sn`), Nmap automatically ping scans with `ICMP Echo Requests` (`-PE`). Once such a request is sent, we usually expect an `ICMP reply` if the pinging host is alive. The more interesting fact is that our previous scans did not do that because before Nmap could send an ICMP echo request, it would send an `ARP ping` resulting in an `ARP reply`. We can confirm this with the "`--packet-trace`" option. To ensure that ICMP echo requests are sent, we also define the option (`-PE`) for this.

```bash
clue@machine[~]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace

Another way to determine why Nmap has our target marked as "alive" is with the "`--reason`" option.

```bash
clue@machine[~]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --reason

We see here that `Nmap` does indeed detect whether the host is alive or not through the `ARP request` and `ARP reply` alone. To disable ARP requests and scan our target with the desired `ICMP echo requests`, we can disable ARP pings by setting the "`--disable-arp-ping`" option. Then we can scan our target again and look at the packets sent and received.

```bash
clue@machine[~]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping
