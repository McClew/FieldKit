# Snippets

This section of the Field Manual serves as a concise repository of frequently used command-line instructions, code fragments, and tactical sequences.

Unlike the "Tooling" section, which focuses on describing individual applications, "Snippets" provides ready-to-use, actionable lines of code or commands designed to perform specific, often repetitive, tasks efficiently during a penetration test.

This section aims to expedite workflows by offering immediate access to tested and proven solutions for common scenarios, ranging from quick data manipulation to establishing basic network connections or executing reconnaissance queries. Its purpose is to act as a quick-reference cheat sheet, enhancing the speed and effectiveness of operations by minimising the need to recall or re-learn common technical procedures.
