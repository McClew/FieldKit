# SSH Key Hunting Command

Certain files, such as SSH keys, do not have standard file extensions. In cases like these, it may be possible to identify files by standard content such as header and footer values. For example, SSH private keys always begin with `-----BEGIN [...SNIP...] PRIVATE KEY-----`. Use tools like grep to recursively search the file system for them during post-exploitation.

```shell
clue@machine[/]$ grep -rnE '^\-{5}BEGIN [A-Z0-9]+ PRIVATE KEY\-{5}$' /* 2>/dev/null

/home/jsmith/.ssh/id_ed25519:1:-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
/home/jsmith/.ssh/SSH.private:1:-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
/home/jsmith/Documents/id_rsa:1:-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
<SNIP>
```
