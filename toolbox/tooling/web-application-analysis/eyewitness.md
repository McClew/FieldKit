# EyeWitness

EyeWitness is designed to take screenshots of websites provide some server header info, and identify default credentials if known.

EyeWitness is designed to run on Kali Linux. It will auto detect the file you give it with the -f flag as either being a text file with URLs on each new line, nmap xml output, or nessus xml output. The --timeout flag is completely optional, and lets you provide the max time to wait when trying to render and screenshot a web page.

## Using EyeWitness

EyeWitness can take the XML output from both [nmap](../information-gathering/network-enumeration/nmap/ "mention") and Nessus and create a report with screenshots of each web application present on the various ports using Selenium. It will also take things a step further and categorise the applications where possible, fingerprint them, and suggest default credentials based on the application.

It can also be given a list of IP addresses and URLs and be told to pre-pend `http://` and `https://` to the front of each. It will perform DNS resolution for IPs and can be given a specific set of ports to attempt to connect to and screenshot.

The below example uses the default `--web` option to take screenshots using the Nmap XML output from the discovery scan as input.

```bash
clue@machine[~]$ eyewitness --web -x web_discovery.xml -d inlanefreight_eyewitness
