# JoomlaScan

A free and open source software to find the components installed in Joomla CMS, built out of the ashes of Joomscan.

{% hint style="info" %}
## Download & Install

[https://github.com/drego85/JoomlaScan](https://github.com/drego85/JoomlaScan)
{% endhint %}

## Setup

`JoomlaScan` is a bit out-of-date and requires Python2.7 to run. We can get it running by first making sure some dependencies are installed.

```bash
sudo python2.7 -m pip install urllib3
sudo python2.7 -m pip install certifi
sudo python2.7 -m pip install bs4
```
